# PPME-Python-Plex-Missing-Episodes
A Python script for finding your missing episodes on Plex.
<br/>

Your library must have matched the shows using the TVDB agent. If not, this will act weird. It is set by default. If you changed it, you must "fix match" using TVDB.

<br/>

You will need:

<br/>

1. A TVDB API key (https://thetvdb.com/dashboard/account/apikey)
2. Python 3.x
<br/>
You can edit the file to add shows to ignore.
Remember to escape "'" symbols with "\\".
