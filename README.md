# PPME-Python-Plex-Missing-Episodes
A Python script for finding your missing episodes on Plex.

Your library must have matched the shows using the TVDB agent. If not, this will act weird. It is set by default. If you changed it, you must "fix match" using TVDB.

You must have Python installed to run this. I've only tested on Linux.

Remember to escape "'" symbols with "\".
